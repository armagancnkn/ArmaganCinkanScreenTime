# MOTİVATİON

  The main aim of this project is to develop an in-depth understanding of digital behaviors through the analysis of individual screen time usage habits. Nowadays, digital devices have become an integral part of people's daily lives, and understanding individuals' device usage times is critical for assessing impacts on digital well-being. The project aims to examine temporal variations of screen time use, possible habits, and the effects of this use on potential productivity or burnout.
In addition to providing insights into user behavior, this analysis can also enable the development of individual recommendations to develop more productive digital habits and optimize screen time management. It can also form the basis for broader academic studies in areas such as digital addiction, productivity and mental health.

This project aims to:

* Identify temporal trends in screen time usage.
* Examine potential correlations between app usage patterns and daily routines.
* Provide personalized recommendations to improve digital well-being and productivity.
* Additionally, the findings may serve as a foundation for developing tools to promote healthier digital practices and reduce screen-related fatigue.

# Dataset Description

The dataset comprises individual screen time records collected from a smartphone over a specific time period. The data contains the following attributes:
Date: The day on which the screen time was recorded.
Categories: App usage grouped into categories such as Social Media, Entertainment, Games, Travel, Utilities, Creativity, etc.
Time Spent: Duration of app usage in each category, recorded in minutes.

The data was manually transcribed from the screen time monitoring feature of the smartphone into a structured CSV format.
Key features of the dataset:

* Temporal resolution: Daily breakdown of screen time.
* Granularity: Detailed category-level time tracking.
* Accessibility: The dataset is anonymized and will not be publicly shared in raw form, ensuring privacy.

# Project Idea
 The project is centered on exploring screen time data to extract meaningful patterns and insights. Specific goals include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Summarize daily and category-wise screen time usage.
- Visualize time distribution trends using bar charts and heatmaps.

Behavioral Insights:
- Identify peak usage periods and frequently used categories.
- Correlate usage trends with productivity indicators.

Recommendations:
- Suggest strategies for balancing screen time based on findings.
- Highlight apps or categories contributing to excessive usage.

Future Extensions:
- Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast screen time patterns.
- Analyze how changes in habits impact overall productivity.

# Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Ensure data consistency and fill missing values where necessary.
Convert raw data into a format suitable for analysis.

Analysis Techniques:
Perform descriptive statistics for each category.
Use Python-based libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) for data visualization.

Visualization:
Create time-series plots to observe trends.
Generate category-wise pie charts and bar graphs.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, draft personalized suggestions to enhance digital habits.


# Findings

Preliminary findings include:
*Significant variation in screen time usage between weekdays and weekends.
*Social Media and Entertainment apps dominate usage patterns.
*Late evening hours see the highest screen engagement.
*Detailed insights and visualizations will be provided as part of the final project report.

# Limitations and Future Work

Limitations:
* The dataset reflects only a single individual's behavior and may not generalize to a broader population.
* Manual data collection introduces potential transcription errors.
* Lack of contextual data (e.g., user’s activities or goals) limits the interpretability of findings.

Future Work:
* Expand the dataset by incorporating data from multiple users.
* Include contextual factors such as mood, location, or purpose of usage.
* Develop an interactive dashboard to track and analyze screen time in real time.
